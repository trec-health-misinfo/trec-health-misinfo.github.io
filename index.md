# TREC Health Misinformation Track (2021)


## Track Overview
Misinformation represents a key problem when using search engines to guide any decision-making task: Are users able to discern authoritative from unreliable information and correct from incorrect information? This problem is further exacerbated when the search occurs within uncontrolled data collections, such as the web, where information can be unreliable, misleading, highly technical, and can lead to unfounded escalations. Information from search-engine results can significantly influence decisions, and research shows that increasing the amount of incorrect information about a topic presented in a Search Engine Result Page (SERP) can impel users to make incorrect decisions.

In this context, the TREC 2021 Misinformation track fosters research on retrieval methods that promote reliable and correct information over misinformation. The 2021 track is still being designed. Bookmark this page to keep up to date with any changes.
